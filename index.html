      <h4>
        Hello Im Darwin Pagunsan Dingle, 20 years old from Lipay Villasis Pangasinan.
        I'm the oldest son of Mr Sonny L. Dingle and Mrs. Mary Jane P. Dingle. I have two siblings named
        Den-Niel P. Dingle and Kristine Joy P. Dingle. I am an artistic person and I have so many hobbies.
        I can draw, sing and play instrument like guitar and ukelele(basics). I love to design things like color
        combination of
        things etc. I also love playing computer and mobile games like Wildrift, PUBG, and Mobile Legends. I am a
        friendly person and
        easy to approach so dont be shy with me. I also love watching kdramas and movies especially on genre of horror
        and action.
        I dont like playing sports because I dont want to sweat. I am currently studying in my 2nd year of Bachelor of
        Science in Information
        Technology in Pangasinan State University Urdaneta City. I chose this course because I want to create games and
        websites for people.
        I have friends and college which are my friends also in the past when we are in Senior High. They are Jether
        John Mendoza, Xye Rapada and Clint Shane
        Angelo from other section. Every week we see each other and we eat, play and enjoy things. In the future we want
        to have atleast one of us can have a car to use for
        our road trip or vacation. But for now, we decide to buy bikes for roadtrip in our town or close town. We go to
        our old friends and we eat together.
        We are so close like brothers. But now we focus on academics because midterms are very near. We will still see
        each other
        to review and eat. We know we can gradute this course so that we can earn some money and buy what we want.
